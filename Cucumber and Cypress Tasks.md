**Cucumber**

- Implement a feature file in java that compares two lists to ensure
  they contain the same items with three attributes (name, price, and
  category), regardless of order. If there are discrepancies, log a
  detailed message specifying which items and columns do not match. You
  can use any Java versions, libraries, frameworks and tools.

- Feature file which should be implemented is located here:
  https://github.com/matepapphu/interview/blob/main/task.feature

**Cypress**

Write a Cypress test in GitHub (or send code in text editor) to perform
the following actions:

1\. Open the page:
<https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/#/login>

2\. Log in using the customer \'Harry Potter\'

3\. Deposit 100, 10 and 5. Check always that the confirmation message
contains \'Deposit Successful\'

4\. Verify that the Balance is 115

5\. Check that the sum of the amounts in the Transaction screen is equal
to 115

6\. Implement github pipeline (using github actions) that automatically
runs the test suite inside docker
